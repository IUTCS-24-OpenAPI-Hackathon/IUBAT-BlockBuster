## Project Collaboration Story
The main challenge of this project was selecting the most suitable APIs. As free APIs often have limitations, we focused on maximizing the value obtained while minimizing API requests for efficiency. Time management and teamwork were crucial aspects of our project. Abdullah Miraz handled authentication and documentation, ensuring smooth collaboration among team members. Shahidul Alam managed API calls and backend tasks, while Nazmus Sakib Apurbo took charge of frontend development. We thoroughly reviewed the requirements and appreciated the judges' clarifications. Despite facing challenges, we enjoyed participating in the hackathon. We attempted to scrape images using Puppeteer and Selenium but found them inefficient for our project due to potential delays and adverse effects on user experience.

## Conclusion
Map Master is a versatile tool designed to streamline travel planning and exploration. With its robust technology stack and community-driven approach, it offers a seamless experience for travel enthusiasts. We thank IUT for organizing this hackathon and providing an opportunity for us to showcase our skills and creativity.
